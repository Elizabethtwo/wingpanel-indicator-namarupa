# ![icon](data/icon.png) Wingpanel Namarupa Indicator

![Screenshot](data/shot.png)

## Name Inspiration

The name Namarupa is used for the forces at play that govern the Ayatana, in Buddhism. Since this indicator manages the system tray icons which are under the Ayatana project, it seems clever to name this Namarupa.

## Before Installation

Version odin (eos6) you need indicator-application:
```bash  
sudo apt-get install indicator-application
```

(All versions)You need to add Pantheon to the list of desktops abled to work with indicators:  

- With autostart (thanks to JMoerman)  

System settings -> "Applications" -> "Startup" -> "Add Startup Appâ€¦" -> "Type in a custom command"

Add /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-application/indicator-application-service as custom command to the auto start applications in the system settings  

-  With a patch
